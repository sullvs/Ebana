# Ebana
Ebana is a stuttering correction system designed to help people who stutter (PWS) communicate more easily by converting their stuttered speech into fluent text and voice. This project uses an Arabic speech dataset, collaboratively collected with King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) and online sources. Ebanaâ€™s methodology integrates the NeuralSpace Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM), and Elevenlabs voice cloning technology. Evaluation shows promising results, with an MOS score of 86.1% for subjective assessments, a word error rate (WER) of 33.11% for ASR, 12.74% for LLM, and a Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) of 19.32 for voice cloning. Ebana aims to provide PWS with a user-friendly way to communicate confidently.
